# Library_Management_UIC

This was my project for CS 480 - Database Systems at UIC. 

The deliverables are:
• ER-model: Each group should develop an ER-model for the application. This can be uploaded as any type of image file
(please do not use esoteric formats).
• Relational schema: The second deliverable is a translation of the ER-model into a relational schema implemented as
an SQL script. The script should use Oracle’s SQL dialect and should execute without errors on the fourier.cs.iit.edu
Oracle accounts. Besides from defining tables and constraints, this script should create indexes where appropriate. Please
upload the script as a simple text file.
• Application: The last deliverable is a online grocery management application that uses the relational schema defined in
the first two deliverables. This application can be either a web or desktop application.


The front-end used was the command-line prompt, the back-end used was python and we used PostgreSQL for formulating SQL commands. 

Attached are the files used for final submission in this course.
